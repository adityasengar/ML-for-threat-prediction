This code extracts the source data and runs a deep neural network to predict the scores based on the algorithm discussed in the paper.

Box #1 imports the relevant libraries.

Box #2 imports the data, expands the data using the variable 'expand' and 'iteration_count', and runs the 2 component PCA over the data.

Box #3 generates the additional score column using user-defined distributions (chosen from 4 distributions)

Box #4 generates the test and training data

Box #5 runs the n-componenet PCA analysis and redefines the test and training data based on the results from PCA

Box #6 generates the deep neural network and compiles it

Box #7 Generates the accuracy scores.

Box #8 genertes the distribution of data in each feature set and scatter plot between few variables.

Box #9 plots the accuracy as the dataset increases
